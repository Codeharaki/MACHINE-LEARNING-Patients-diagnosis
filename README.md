# -MACHINE-LEARNING-Patients-prognosis

## Description
In  this project,  we apply different  technics  of  machine  learning  on a realworld  dataset.  The dataset containsdata  of  patients  from  the  Centre  Hopitalier  Universitaire  (CHU)  of  Toulouse. 
The  objective  of  this dataset is to predict the diagnosis according to lesion and patient characteristics.Each  lesion  is  described  according  to  its  oral characteristics (e.g. shape, color) and the patients characteristics (age, sex, smoking status). The objective is to predict both the diagnosis (multi-categorical prediction) and the dysplasia status (binary prediction).

## Method used
Correlation have been tested and unecessary parameters have been removed, Principal component analysis(PCA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of parameters.
Then we train the model on splitted data using k-nearest neighbors algorithm, in order to classify and predict future diagnosis.

## Built in
Jupyter Notebook
